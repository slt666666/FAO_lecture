1. Mutmap
    - Contents
    - Basic knowledge (プログラム 3/21, テキスト・図 3/22)
        - If you wanna know which genetic variants(/mutations) change phenotype ?
          -> genotype infomration is required
        - Read alignment & visualization
        - SNP calling
        - simple example (only 1 SNP == QTL)
        - summary: SNP can be used as QTL identification
    - Mutmap (プログラム 3/23, テキスト・図3/24-25)
        - However, real situation (ex. Rice: Susceptible vs Resistance)
        - try to compare Parents SNPs -> a lot of SNPs -> which SNP is causal loci?
        -> Mutmap is one approach
        - We will try to use Mutmap to identify causal genomic regions using real situation.
        - 1st. make F2 population
        -> Sequencing all samples required cost!
        - 2nd. phenotyping & bulked Sequence
        - Calculate SNP-index
        - Visualize SNP-index
        - Check results
        - Mutmap Review
        - Real dataset
        -> sequence error, etc -> sliding window.
        - Simulation?

2. QTL-seq
    - real situation (ex. Rice: Grain number?)
    - compare parents SNPs -> basically a lot of SNPs affect
    - so Mutmap? -> Mutmap doesn't work for quantitative traits
    -> QTL-seq is one approach
    - We will try to use Mutmap to identify causal genomic regions using real situation.
    - 1st. make F2 population
    -> c.f.) GWAS is one approach, but it have to sequencing all samples.
    - 2nd. phenotyping & bulked 2 population.
    - Calculate delta SNP-index
    - Visualize SNP-index & delta SNP-index
    - Check results
    - QTL-seq review
    - Real dataset
    - Sliding window analysis
    - Simulation?

3. Genomic Prediction
    - Mutmap & QTL-seq is cost effective methods, but just introduce high cost approach
    - Mutmap & QTL-seq identified QTLs with significant effect
    - c.f.) GWAS can identify QTLs across whole genome
    - For Genome breeding, we wanna know the effect of QTLs and multiple traits.
    -> Genomic prediction model is one approach
    -> if GP model created, we can estimate effect of genomic regions for multiple traits
    -> You can customize phenotypes. 
    - But required huge datasets like NAM, MAGIC...etc
    - Sequening & phenotyping
    - Make Prediction model (ex. Liner model)
    - Visualize locus effect
    - Play with GP
